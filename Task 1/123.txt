The NBA will partner with two local Indiana-serving organizations to serve as charity beneficiaries for the 73rd NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 18. Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis will represent the West All-Stars and Special Olympics Indiana will represent the East All-Stars. Each organization will begin with a starting donation of $100,000 with the opportunity to raise an additional $240,000 to the organization whose team wins the All-Star Game. As part of the NBA Cares State Farm Assist Tracker Program, an additional $1,900 will be raised for each assist during the game that will be split between the two organizations.
