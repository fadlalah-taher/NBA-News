Bogdan BogdanoviÄ‡ is a Serbian professional basketball player for the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA. He also represents the Serbian national team. Bogdanovic left a good impression on offense and carried the team from a scoring perspective in route to a tight win over the Cavaliers. The veteran sharpshooter has started in each of Atlanta's last six games due to the absence of Trae Young (finger) but has been thriving, putting up 14.7 points per game. He is, however, shooting just 39.7 percent from the field and 35 percent from deep in that span, so there's still room for improvement.
