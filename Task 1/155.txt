Who will finish with the worst record in the National Basketball Association? Although the San Antonio Spurs and Charlotte Hornets lurk, this appears to be a two-team race between the Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards, both weakened further after dumping assets at the trade deadline and through buyouts.

Just by chance that it’s the Pistons or Spurs tossup for worst record, they meet in the season finale. Stay tuned.
