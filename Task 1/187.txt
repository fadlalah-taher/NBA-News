The forthcoming season will also witness the imposition of fresh rules about the resting of star players. To maintain the game’s allure and ensure the availability of star players for national TV and in-season games, no more than one-star player will be made unavailable for the same game. This move reflects the NBA’s understanding of the pivotal role star players play in drawing audiences and generating excitement, and the new rule aims to balance players' well-being with the fans' expectations. 
With this action, the NBA reaffirms it will ensuring that skill and talent continue to be the game's cornerstone.
