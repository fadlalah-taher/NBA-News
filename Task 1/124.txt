As part of the STARRY 3-Point Contest during NBA All-Star Saturday Night, STARRY is donating $50,000 to the NBA Foundation to support the HBCU Community and if any player scores 30 points in a round, STARRY will donate $300,000.
As part of the Stephen vs Sabrina 3-Point Challenge, Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry and New York Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu will compete in a three-point contest with each made shot raising additional money for charity. Play and Ionescu’s SI20 foundation will each receive a donation from the NBA and WNBA. Each shot made during “Stephen vs. Sabrina” will also trigger a donation from State Farm® to the NBA Foundation.
