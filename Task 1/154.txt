The Sixers are minus Embiid and the Bucks are still working on defense four months after the season tipped. The Knicks will be without injured OG Anunoby and Julius Randle perhaps into next month. That leaves only the Cleveland Cavaliers in pursuit — and trailing the Celtics by six games as the All-Star break ends. The East is surely the Celtics’ to lose, and a stumble doesn’t appear realistic as long as Jayson Tatum and a deep roster refuse to allow any hint of a slump. Six of their last seven are at home, where Boston has lost only three times all season.
