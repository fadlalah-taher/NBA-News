Jalen Marquis McDaniels (born January 31, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs. McDaniels (illness) will be available to play Thursday against the Suns, Josh Lewenberg of TSN.ca reports.
Impact While McDaniels will be available, that doesn't necessarily mean he'll touch the floor. He's an inconsistent part of the rotation and can safely remain on the waiver wire in most leagues. This season 2023-24 statistics are 2.7 points, 1.2 rebounds, 0.5 assists and 32.7 FG% per game.
