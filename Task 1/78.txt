Toumani Camara born May 8, 2000 (23 years) is a Belgian professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association. Raised in Belgium, he moved to the United States to attend Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School in Hollywood, Florida. Camara (illness) is questionable for Friday's game versus Houston. Camara has missed the past two games for Portland, but he remains day-to-day. If Camara is unable to suit up Friday, Kris Murray would likely soak up the majority of his minutes. This season 2023-24 statistics are 7.2 points, 4.9 rebound, 1.1 assists and 43.4 FG % per game.
