The West is better, but so are the Nuggets. They're winning at a higher clip than they did last year, when they won the West. Minnesota and OKC with something to prove in the regular season, the Nuggets are just biding their time until they get to April, and yet the two up-and-comers are only one game up in the standings. The question suggests that Phoenix exposed some sort of Denver vulnerability, which I'm not co-signing. I thought that the Suns could pose the biggest challenge to the Denver Nuggets repeating as West champions and the loss the other night demonstrated.
