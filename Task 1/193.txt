In the league's resting policy memo, these are five benefits the NBA hopes emerges from the new rules, via ESPN: Achieve greater player participation in the NBA's full 82-game regular season, Minimize multiple star player absences in the same game, improve fan and public perception and Promote compliance via bright-line rules and higher penalties. There's also a transparency factor in terms of gambling, as the NBA is "projected to receive $167 million in revenue from casinos and betting, an 11% increase from last season," according to ESPN, citing sources.
