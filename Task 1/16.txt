Keyonte George (born 2003) is an American professional basketball player for the Utah Jazz of the NBA. He played college basketball for the Baylor Bears. He was a consensus five star recruit and one of the top players in the 2022 class. George, Jazz(15.1%): Speaking of empowered young guards, George has assumed the command of the Utah offense even amid a veteran-laden backcourt. The Jazz trust George to run the pick and roll and pick his spots as a scorer and passer, which has led to some really fun fantasy results. George (illness) has been ruled out for Wednesday's game against the Bulls.
