Paul Reed is an American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA. He played college basketball for the DePaul Blue Demons. Shifting back into the starting five after coming off the bench for three games, Reed responded with his fifth double-double of the season. Joel Embiid (knee) doesn't appear to be close to returning from knee surgery, so Reed will continue filling a large role in the Sixers' frontcourt, but his production has been erratic. Over 16 games since Embiid went down, Reed is averaging 8.8 points, 7.8 boards, 1.6 assists and 1.3 blocks over 25.4 minutes a contest.
