Rebounds: Andre Drummond (15.1%) does one thing at an elite level: clean the glass. We also find Charlotte's Nick Richards (11.8%) having success on the boards. Domantas Sabonis has the most rebounds. Blocks: The minutes have dipped a bit for Precious Achiuwa (19.5%), but it's impressive that his rim protection rates still surface. The 76ers lean on Paul Reed (8.2%) as their primary center in most looks, which affords real chances to protect the paint. Victor Wembanyama has rejected the most shots this season, with 193 blocks. After Wembanyama comes Brook Lopez with 158 blocks and Chet Holmgren with 157 blocks.
