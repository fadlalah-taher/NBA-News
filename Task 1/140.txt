We won’t get into it too much here because we’ve already got you covered on all things involving the 20-year-old French phenom. The 7-foot-4 Spurs rookie wasn’t selected to play in the 73rd NBA All-Star Game. But it’s safe to say Victor Wembanyama left Indianapolis as one of the weekend’s brightest stars. The No. 1 overall pick competed in the Panini Rising Stars at All-Star 2024 as well as the Kia Skills Challenge at 2024 State Farm All-Star Saturday Night. The rookie showed he can nail impressions, too.
Expect to see Victor Wembanyama at NBA All-Star weekends for years to come.
