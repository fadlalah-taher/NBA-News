In the aftermath of the OG Anunoby trade, the Knicks enter the deadline with two primary objectives: scour the market for another ball-handler and turn Evan Fournier's salary slot into a more useful player who can be dangled as a money matcher and potential assetâ€”in their next blockbuster. Brogdon checks all those boxes. He doesn't saddle the Knicks with as much long-term money as Terry Rozier or Dejounte Murray in the event the transaction goes belly up. Whether his fit is good, bad or indifferent, Brogdon's expiring $22.5 million salary in 2024-25 will remain eminently movable, if not potentially desirable.
