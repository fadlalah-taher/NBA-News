Shaedon Sharpe is a Canadian professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. A consensus five-star recruit out of high school, Sharpe signed to play college basketball with the Kentucky Wildcats, but did not play a game before leaving for the NBA. Sharpe was previously the consensus number one player in the 2022 class before reclassifying. Sharpe was unranked by major recruiting services early in his high school career and became one of the top players in his class in about one year, in part due to his success at the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League in 2021.
