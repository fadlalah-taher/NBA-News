Two of the six guaranteed playoff berths in the East would belong to the No. 4 Orlando Magic and the No. 6 Miami Heat. Hot streaks from both teams have helped them elevate in the standings over the past month. Magic keep rolling: Orlando brings a five-game win streak (and an 8-2 mark in its last 10 games) into their Friday matchup with the Knicks in New York (7:30 ET, NBA App) in the final game of a three-game road trip. Orlando leads NY by a half game, but as the Magic look to complete a 4-0 season series sweep tonight.
