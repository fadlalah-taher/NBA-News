Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James and their combined six Kia NBA Most Valuable Player awards will lead their squads into Friday’s star-studded showdown between the Bucks and Lakers in Los Angeles (10 ET). The matchup features a pair of teams desperate for wins for different reasons. In Los Angeles’ case, it’s all about survival. A 130-120 loss to Sacramento on Wednesday pushed the Lakers to 10th in the Western Conference and gifted the Kings the season-series win and an edge in tiebreak scenarios. Milwaukee, meanwhile, ranks second in the East, a half-game ahead of Cleveland and 7 1/2 games behind the Boston Celtics.
