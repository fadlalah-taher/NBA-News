Immanuel Jaylen Quickley is an American-professional-basketball player for the Toronto of the NBA. He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats. Immanuel, Toronto Raptors (69.7%): Let's not overlook the statistical surge Quickley is delivering in recent games; with Scottie Barnes sidelined, Quickley has taken over lead distribution duties to the tune of 31 dimes across his past three starts as we begin a new week of NBA action. The Raptors are empowering the Kentucky product as a three-level scorer and key creator down the stretch of the season and in games, elevating him to must-add status in all formats.
