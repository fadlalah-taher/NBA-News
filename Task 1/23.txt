Joshua Hart is an American professional basketball player for the New York of the NBA. He was selected in the first round of the 2017 NBA draft by the Jazz with the 30th overall. Hart, New York (54.0%): The team's affinity for Villanova products has paid off at every turn, with Hart's awesome rebounding rate and solid floor-game translating into major fantasy value now that the team relies on him to be more than merely a glue guy most nights. Injuries around the roster have brought to surface more diverse tasks from Hart, and he's answering with awesome numbers nearly every time.
