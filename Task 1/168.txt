Nuggets sweep season series vs. Celtics: Nikola Jokic (32 pts, 12 reb, 11 ast) recorded his 20th triple-double of the season to lead the Nuggets to a 115-109 win over the Celtics to become the only team to win the season series over NBA-leading Boston (48-14). Jamal Murray (19 pts, 8 ast) and Aaron Gordon (16 pts, 9 reb) combined for 35 to help offset Jaylen Brown’s season-high 41 points and a 24-point, 12-board effort from Kristaps Porzingis. Jokic became the fourth player in NBA history with multiple 20+ triple-double seasons – following last season’s career-high 29 with 20 so far this season.
