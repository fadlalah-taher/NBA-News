After their post-In-Season Tournament swoon, the Lakers have collected themselves. Lucky for them, they didn’t lose too much ground in the West during those dark days. There’s nothing that a five-game win streak can’t cure.
The Lakers wasted the good health of LeBron James and Anthony Davis during that stretch. Now Los Angeles must cross its fingers. Can Spencer Dinwiddie, snatched on the buyout market, make a difference? yes, but he’s not an impact player, or else he wouldn’t have been available. The Lakers must get help from the collective — and give their two stars less of a load.
