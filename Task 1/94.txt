Bucher: I was expecting the Cavs to slide even before the recent injuries, because of how they climbed the charts a schedule loaded with sub-.500 teams, which they dispatched with supreme efficiency, winning 25 of 29. Conversely, they have a losing record against winning teams (15-18) and their stretch run is loaded with them; of their final 20 games, 13 are against teams with winning records and nine of them are against teams that are a sixth seed or higher. The Bucks, on the other hand, are one of only three teams in the East with a winning record against teams above 500.
