Kyle Terrell Lowry is an American-professional-basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA. A six-time All-Star, he won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019. Kyle (11.3%): A revival is underway, as this former All-Star has been tasked with big minutes for a team that is not just missing superstar Joel Embiid, but also several key rotation members, namely De'Anthony Melton, to injury. The depleted nature of the roster has resulted in a starting gig for Lowry in recent games, propelling awesome passing results with respectable 3-point volume. Lowry will be rested for Wednesday's game against the Grizzlies.
