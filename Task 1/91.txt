Weitzman: KAT has been fantastic this season (22.1 PPG, 8.4 RPG, 3.0 APG, 50.6 FG%, 42.3 3P%), and deserves a ton of credit for adjusting to life with Rudy Gobert. Coming into the year, I was one of those people who thought the Wolves were doomed because that pairing was no good and KAT has proven me wrong. His loss is obviously a big blow to the Wolves. There are two reasons. One is that in Naz Reid, the Wolves have a really good big backup who can now slide into KAT's spot. But the Wolves' season is not over.
