Between this timeline for NBA expansion and Golden State Warriors owner Joe Lacob casually saying he'd be interested in buying the A's if they were put up for sale, could there be a sliver of a hope that the owners vote down relocation? They won't do it because they feel bad for the people of Oakland, but they may do it if they feel like they want to cash in with Vegas and either the timing isn't right, or the owner (John Fisher) isn't a fit to steer that ship. If a Las Vegas baseball team fails, that's bad for the league.
