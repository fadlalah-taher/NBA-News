Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks. Last week’s ranking: No. 3.
Season stats: 30.7 ppg, 11.2 rpg, 6.3 apg.
His case, Antetokounmpo returned to the lineup Wednesday after sitting out Monday due to left Achilles tendinitis. But even the two-time MVP couldn’t help the Bucks in a 125-90 loss to Golden State. The 29 year old scored 23 points with seven rebounds and six assists. Still, the Warriors manhandled the bigger Bucks in the paint, outrebounding them 50-36 while outscoring them 54-36 in that area. Additionally, rookie Trayce Jackson-Davis flat-out gave Antetokounpo fits.
