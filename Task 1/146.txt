The National Basketball Association returned to the original Eastern Conference versus Western Conference, 48-minute format for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game after experimenting with alternative set-ups in recent years.
The move drew rave reviews from players, including Lillard, who explained that last year’s format threw off players due to uncertainty about which team they’d ultimately land on ahead of tipoff for the game. Remember, All-Star 2023 in Utah featured the captains format, which was first introduced in 2018. That game added a new twist involving those captains picking their teams in a live “draft” from a stage near the court.
