DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic scored 33 apiece to lead the Bulls to a 125-122 road win over the Warriors and lift the Bulls one game below .500 (31-32). The last time Chicago was .500 was at 2-2 back in October. A DeRozan and-1 three-point play put the Bulls ahead for good with 23 seconds left, part of a wild finish that saw the game tied once and lead change three times. The Bulls hold the No. 9 spot in the East Play-In, increasing their lead over the No. 10 Hawks to 2.5 games while pulling within 3.5 games of No. 8 Indy.
