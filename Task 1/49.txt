Ben Simmons has been limited to 15 games this season. He missed 38 straight at one point and has sat out the last five. The No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft ends this season with averages of 6.1 points, 7.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists. He has not finished a season since the Nets acquired him from Philadelphia at the trade deadline in 2022."Simmons, along with his representatives and Nets medical personnel, are currently in discussions with numerous experts to determine the course of action that will provide him with the best opportunity for long-term sustainable health," the Nets said.
