The Skills Challenge came down to a tie-breaker round, comprised of half-court shots. Haliburton swished his half-court bucket for the win more than 20 seconds faster than Team All-Stars accomplished the feat. “We felt like there was a lot of energy in the building,” Haliburton said. “And good for people to see our city for what it is, rather than, when they come here, they don’t really go out because we play the next day or whatever. They can actually enjoy the city.”. Speaking of Indiana, did you catch native Babyface’s awesome performance of the national anthem?
