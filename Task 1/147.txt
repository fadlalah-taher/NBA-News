Which team will hold best record in the West? Well, let’s rephrase the question — how badly do the Clippers want it? If the hottest team since early December makes this a priority, then favor LA. However, given their history, it wouldn’t be shocking if the Clippers pump the brakes the final few weeks and rest their stars. Same for the defending champion Denver Nuggets. But not the Minnesota Timberwolves or Oklahoma City Thunder, young and thirsty teams who would love the status that comes with first place and, more importantly, the benefit of home-court advantage.
