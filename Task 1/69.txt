On the way to dropping a rough loss to the Chicago Bulls at home on Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors All-Star point guard exited the game with an apparent ankle injury. Late in the fourth quarter, Curry appeared to roll his ankle. While he attempted to jog down the court, Curry quickly exited the game. Curry later left the game to the locker room. Without Curry, the Warriors didn’t have an answer for DeMar DeRozan down the stretch in a tight 125-122 loss to the Bulls. Following the game, Steve Kerr didn’t provide clarity on Curry’s potential injury.
