Houston Jerami Grant is an American professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange and was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft. Grant is questionable to play Friday against the Rockets due to soreness in his right hamstring. Impact Friday's game will be the first of a back-to-back, so it wouldn't be shocking to see Grant hit the sidelines. If he opts to sit, Jabari Walker would have an opportunity to start and would make for an attractive streaming option.
