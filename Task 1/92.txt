Bucher: This is in no way an indictment of Towns or how he has played this season, but his absence actually could make them more dangerous. Other than the home loss against Charlotte when coach Chris Finch called him out for deciding after a big first half of scoring (44) he'd go for a career high — which he got, 62 — but did so at the expense of winning the game, Towns has tried to take a balanced approach this season. But there's always been a bit of natural tug-of-war between Towns and Anthony Edwards, since their primary values are as scorers.
