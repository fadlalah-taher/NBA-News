Aside from Reid, though, the Wolves are somewhat thin on the frontline and will likely put more of the scoring onus on Edwards — the team’s leading scorer at 26.1 ppg — as Towns mends. Last season, Towns missed 52 games because of a strained calf muscle. He returned in time for the team’s playoff push but struggled in the first-round series loss to the Denver Nuggets. He averaged 18.2 ppg and shot just 45.7% overall in that series (25% on 3-pointers) and he and the Wolves have yet to get beyond the first round of the playoffs in their time together.
