What team can still salvage a poor start? This is a coin flip between the Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls with both squads choosing to keep their important pieces at the trade deadline, which was surprising. Given their losing records and roster setup, both teams appeared to be sellers. Now it’s all about salvaging what’s left of a fractured season and making the playoffs. Give the edge to the Hawks, only because the Bulls won’t get Zach LaVine back. Trae Young and Dejounte Murray have another shot, and maybe their last, at redemption in Atlanta.
