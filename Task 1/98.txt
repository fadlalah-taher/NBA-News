I see three teams as being vulnerable right now — the Lakers, Mavs, Pelicans. I would've included the Warriors about two weeks ago, but Jonathan Kuminga has broken out, and they are getting some outstanding play from their other young guns as well. While the Pels are highest in the standings, I have the least faith in them avoiding the play-in tournament or surviving it. That leaves a choice between the Mavs and the Lakers missing out and I'm going to make it simple: I believe in Luka Dončić as a closer more than I do LeBron James right now.
