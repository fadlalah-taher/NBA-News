The Wolves were without Towns in a thrilling 113-111 road win against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday. Even without Towns, Minnesota managed to hold the league’s highest-scoring team nearly 13 points below its average. Towns’ absence moved reserve forward Kyle Anderson into the starting lineup. He finished with six points, three rebounds and four assists vs. the Pacers in 27 minutes. Towns’ absence likely means standout reserve big man Naz Reid will see a bigger role as well. He remained in his bench role vs. the Pacers, finishing with 13 points, eight rebounds and two assists.
