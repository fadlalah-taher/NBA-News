Will Mavs’ frontline additions help them avoid Play-In Tournament? Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington made the Mavericks a big winner at the trade deadline, if only because Dallas added exactly what was needed — some frontline balance for a starry backcourt. Gafford in particular gives the Mavericks added size, and they’ll tinker with the best way to use him and fellow center Dereck Lively II, who’s having an encouraging rookie season.
More rebounds and more paint presence at both ends will help. Of course, Dallas will mainly rise if Luka Doncic keeps looking like a Kia MVP finalist.
