The All-Star was enjoying one of his healthiest seasons in years for the first-place Wolves. All-Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns will require surgery to repair a torn left knee meniscus revealed via MRI, the Timberwolves announced Thursday. He will be re-evaluated in four weeks, putting his availability for the first round of the NBA Playoffs and potentially beyond in doubt. Towns is averaging 22.1 points, 8.4 rebounds and three assists per game this season while shooting 50.6% overall and 42.3% on 3-pointers. He has helped the Wolves (44-19) to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference and the second-best record in the league.
