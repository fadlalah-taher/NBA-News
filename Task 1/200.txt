The second round will also expand the time between picks from two minutes to four. For a third year in a row, the draft will consist of 58 picks instead of the typical 60, this time due to the loss of a second round pick for both the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns for violating the NBA's tampering (an attempt to persuade a player contracted to transfer to another team) rules during free agency. This will be the third straight season in which the NBA draft has only 58 picks instead of the typical 60 due to tampering violations.
