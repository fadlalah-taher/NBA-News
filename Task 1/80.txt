Sterling "Scoot" Henderson is an American professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association. He played for Carlton J. Kell High School in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia, where he was a five-star recruit. Henderson (thigh) is doubtful to play Friday against the Rockets. Impact Henderson is expected to return this weekend, but it sounds like it'll be Saturday and not Friday. Anfernee Simons, Kris Murray and Ashton Haggans will continue to pick up the slack in his absence. This season 2023-24 statistics are 12.9 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 37.5 FG% per game.
