Sitting atop the Western Conference ensures the Timberwolves needn't approach the deadline with feverish urgencyâ€”which is good, because they don't have much to trade. Adding some combination of ball-handling and shooting should be their top priority. It doesn't have to be anyone capable of cracking the full-strength closing lineup. The Wolves' starters are getting the job done at both ends, even if it's a little touch-and-go on offense at times, largely because of turnovers. Finding someone who can elevate the minutes Mike Conley and/or Karl-Anthony Towns log without Anthony Edwards is more Minnesota's speed. Burks can run the offense in blips if you're willing to stomach his occasionally hijacky leanings.
