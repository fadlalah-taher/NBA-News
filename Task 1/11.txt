The Minnesota Timberwolves and Dallas Mavericks, third and fifth, respectively, entering last-week, suffered more than one blip and therefore were not as fortunate. Back-to-back home losses to the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Clippers dropped the T-Wolves to sixth, while a 1-3 week  despite three triple-doubles and a near fourth by Luka Doncic sent the Mavs tumbling to ninth. Taking advantage of that slippage in the West were two teams from the East, the Miami Heat and Orlando Magic. Both have quietly won-six of their last seven. The Clippers had a hiccup but still managed to move up one rung.
