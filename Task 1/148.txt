The initial getting-to-know-you process under the new coach went over as well in Milwaukee as flat beer. That said, maybe this was to be expected. Rivers arrived in midseason under duress. Roles had to be redefined. A system needed to be put in place. This a society of thin patience, and when you add the level of urgency expressed by the resident franchise player, the pressure gets thick. Everything depends on three factors: can the Bucks (with Patrick Beverley) prioritize defense, will Damian Lillard reduce his clunky shooting nights, and are Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton capable of slowing their decline?
