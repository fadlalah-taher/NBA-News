Depending on when the NBA makes their official decision to expand, and which markets they plan to expand into, it would take a few years to get the arena built and the team added onto the NBA schedule. This is pure speculation. The A's are planning on opening up their ballpark in 2028, and some view that timeline as a little optimistic. The team would have one or two years as the new team in town before being trumped by a more expensive project that is easier to get to for locals in a more popular sport.
