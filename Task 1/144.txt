It’s more complicated than that, of course. The digitized floor can display graphics, video, interactive games, and even animations that track players’ movements with graphics such as a trail of stars. The floor was built by ASB GlassFloor, and the technology behind it is LumiFlex, a 27-million-pixel LED screen that sits under a glass sport-court surface. The LED panels are mounted to a frame with air-conditioning installed to keep the lights and everything else underneath cool. The league has said it doesn’t plan to implement these floors soon. But we certainly caught a glimpse of the future. It’s bright.
