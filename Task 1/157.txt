G League guard Mac McClung defended his AT&T Slam Dunk title in Indianapolis last month. Williamson had nine assists and eight rebounds against the Raptors. In his first professional appearance in Toronto, he wowed fans with a powerful fast break dunk late in the second quarter. Still, Williamson said even he preferred teammate Brandon Ingram’s dunk to start the second, when Ingram eluded Toronto’s Jordan Nwora with a crossover before rising above Jontay Porter for a one-handed slam. “You’ve got to give to BI,” Williamson said. “He hit them with the cross, sent that person out of the picture, and then he dunked over somebody.”
