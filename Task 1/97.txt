Denver had an incredibly disjointed first half, trailing by 15 at halftime, and outscored Phoenix 11-3 over the final 3 ½ minutes to force OT. The Nuggets are not a turnover-prone team and the Suns are, but that was flipped in this particular game. Jokic had more turnovers than assists, which happens about once a month. I don't bank on out-of-character performances. There were questions about the Nuggets' depth and bench with the departure of Jeff Green and Bruce Brown, but their main subs — Peyton Watson, Christian Braun and Reggie Jackson — have been solid and efficient.
