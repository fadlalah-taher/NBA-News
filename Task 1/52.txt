Kelly Paul Oubre Jr. is an American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA. The 28-year-old forward appears to be more comfortable in a lead role on Philly's second unit than he is starting. Oubre has topped 20 points in three straight games coming off the bench, averaging 25.3 points, 5.0 boards, 3.0 assists and 1,7 threes in 32.0 minutes a contest. With the shorthanded Sixers scrambling to replace Joel Embiid (knee) and Tyrese Maxey (concussion) right now, don't expect Oubre's usage to change as long as he's productive. The 2023-24 season statistics are 14.4 points per game.
