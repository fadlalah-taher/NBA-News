It was an eventful 24 hours for G League Ignite at NBA All-Star Weekend. On Friday night during the Rising Stars competition, Team Detlef (G League) upset Team Pau (featuring rookies Victor Wembanyama and Brandon Miller) thanks to a game-winning shot by Ignite prospect Matas Buzelis. On Saturday morning, Andscape's Marc J. Spears reported that Ignite's Ron Holland would miss the rest of the season with a right thumb injury. And in addressing the media Saturday night, NBA commissioner Adam Silver called into question the long-term future of Ignite because of the emergence of name, image and likeness deals in college.
