A healthy menu of marquee matchups last week simultaneously saw the Boston Celtics fortify their hold on the No. 1 spot in NBA power rankings and a cluster of teams most notably the defending champion Denver Nuggets rev their engines loud enough for the Celtics to know they can't afford to ease up on their torrid pace. The Celtics finished a 3-0 week by annihilating the previously surging Golden State Warriors, 140-88. They've now won 11 in a row. But they were not the only top-10 team with title aspirations to go undefeated last week and extend their winning streaks.
