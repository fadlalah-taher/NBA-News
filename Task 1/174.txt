Excelling on both ends: In addition to his 24.8 ppg (16th in NBA), AD ranks in the top five in rebounding (4th, 12.3 rpg) and blocks (5th, 2.4 bpg, his highest mark as a Laker). Davis is one of only two players (along with Wemby) to average at least 20 points, 10 boards and two blocks per game. First matchup: This is the first of two meetings between these teams over the next three weeks. The Bucks have won four of the last five matchups.
