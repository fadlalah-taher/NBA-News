A defensive point guard primarily plays on the perimeter, just like an offensive one. Their goal is to make the opposing point guard as ineffective as possible. A defensive point guard will try to accomplish this with constant pressure on the ball, making it difficult to maintain possession. A defensive point guard will also pressure opponents in passing lanes to generate steals and scoring opportunities for their team. Current NBA point guards known for their defensive prowess include Jrue Holiday, Luka Doncic, Fred VanVleet, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Kyrie Irving, Jalen Brunson, LaMelo Ball, James Harden (Philadelphia) and Tyrese Haliburton.
