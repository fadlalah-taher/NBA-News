Neither terrific nor awful for more than a night or two at a time, Chicago has won the first two on its four-game West Coast trip. Which fits, because it hasnâ€™t won or lost more than two in a row for the past two months. The Bulls seem headed toward a finish remarkably similar to last season. Then, they were 28-34 after 62 games but used a decent finishing kick (12-7) to bump from 11th to 10th in the East. They went to Toronto to win one Play-In game, then to Miami where they had the Heat in trouble until the final minutes.
