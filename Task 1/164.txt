Lots of bad stuff. Some pretty good stuff. Significant injuries for several players, notably Zach LaVine and Patrick Williams. Considerable development from others, particularly Coby White and Ayo Dosunmu. An early five-game losing streak, followed by a four-game winning streak. Average it out and it explains where the Bulls sit today: At 30-32, they have sought their level once again and that level is the Play-In Tournament. Heading into their game at Golden State Thursday (10 ET, National Basketball Association League Pass), they sit ninth in the Eastern Conference, 5 1/2 games out of sixth and 5 out of 11th.
