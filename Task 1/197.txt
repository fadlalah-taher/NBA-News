Jock Landale, Victor Oladipo, 2024 second-round pick (second-most favorable from Brooklyn, Golden State and Oklahoma City, via Houston), 2025 first-round pick (lottery protection; turns into two second-rounders if not conveyed). Oklahoma City has the right to swap its 2025 first-rounder with Houston's pick if it falls outside the top 10. Houston has the right to swap whatever first it ends up with for Brooklyn's selection. Injecting instant scoring and floor-spacing into the rotation would do wonders for a Houston Rockets team that still ranks fifth in points allowed per possession but dwells inside the bottom 10 of offensive efficiency.
