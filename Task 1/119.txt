The NBA season only lasts until the middle of April-unless the team makes it into the playoffs. Then it could last until June, which is half of the baseball season. If the A's are out of it after a couple of months like they have been these past two seasons, then fans may just not go to games that year. There is also the fact that all of these events cost money, and with so many different options for sports and entertainment in Vegas, residents will only have so much cash to spend while also needing to afford gas, groceries, and other necessities.
