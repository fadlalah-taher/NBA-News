Landry Michael Shamet is an American professional basketball player for the Washington Wizards of the NBA. He played college basketball for the Wichita State Shockers and was selected 26th overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2018 NBA draft. Shamet is listed as questionable for Friday's game versus the Hornets due to left calf soreness. Shamet presumably suffered his injury during Wednesday's loss to Orlando. If the 26-year-old guard is ruled out, Jordan Poole, Corey Kispert and Johnny Davis are candidates to receive increased playing time. This season 2023-24 statistics are 7.3 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game.
