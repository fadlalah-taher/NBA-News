Donovan Michell is an American professional basketball player. Mitchell leads the Cleveland in scoring (28.0 points per-game) and is putting up career-best numbers in rebounds, assists and steals during his second-season with Cleveland. While the team said Mitchell has a bone bruise. "It’s more of a wear-and-tear thing," Bickerstaff said. "It was like a tendinitis-type thing that kind of just flared up. So it’s something that just built over time."
The Cavs are hoping a platelet-rich plasma injection Mitchell received on Monday will speed up his return. Until then, Cleveland, will have to cope without its best player and leader.
