Benjamin David Simmons is an Australian professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association. He played college basketball for one season with the LSU Tigers, after which he was named a consensus first-team All-American. Ben Simmons will miss the remainder of the 2023-24 season, the third straight year the former All-Star's campaign has ended early because of back problems. The Brooklyn Nets said Thursday that Simmons will use the time he is out to consult with specialists and seek treatment options for the pinched nerve in his lower back that has sidelined him twice this season.
