TORONTO (AP); New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson said he will enter the NBA dunk contest on one condition: he is got to be picked as an All-Star, too. After scoring 16 points in a 139-98 win at Toronto on Tuesday, Williamson was asked whether he sees himself taking part in the dunk contest in the future. Williamson was an All-Star for the first time in 2021, his second season. He missed all of the following season because of a foot injury. Williamson was an All Star again last year but skipped the game because of a hamstring injury.
