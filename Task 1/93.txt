The Cavs, this season, have actually been better with Mobley off the floor. They've outscored opponents by 1.5 possessions with him on the court and 6.5 when he's off. That's not because Mobley is bad. It's just that the fit with him and Jarrett Allen has not been a good one. Both are big men and in today's NBA it's hard to play two bigs. And at this point, Allen is a better player. In fact, the Cavs' hot stretch over the past few months has come as a result of them surrounding Allen and their guard with wings who can shoot.
