Oklahoma City Thunder to No. 3. Nobody had a more disjointed week than the Oklahoma City Thunder, who both suffered the wrath of Victor Wembanyama and moved into first place in the Western Conference. Normally a double digit loss to the last place team in the conference would be costly in the power rankings, but A) Victory Wembanyama has been a one-man wrecking crew of late that has made his San Antonio Spurs more formidable, and B) it is the Thunder's one loss in weeks, having won seven of their last eight. OKC only slid one spot, to No. 3.
