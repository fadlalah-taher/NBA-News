CHICAGO; The first sign that this season was going, um, different for the Chicago Bulls came at the very start. After a 124-104 drubbing by Oklahoma City on opening night at United Center, the locker room stayed closed afterward for a players-only meeting. That’s right, a tactic most often deployed in the depths of a losing streak or during a dreary midseason lull got unsheathed one game in. Panic? Accountability? Reactions bracketed the moment, it was either a very bad sign or a very good sign — and frankly, that’s how this season has gone ever since for the Bulls.
