The Lakers and Bucks both enter Friday’s game looking to rebound from Wednesday losses. Milwaukee saw its six-game win streak snapped with a 35-point loss at Golden State in the first of a four-game West Coast trip. The Lakers gave up a 19-point first-quarter lead as they fell to the Kings 130-120 at home to drop to 10th in the West. Davis on the verge: Friday’s game will be Anthony Davis’ 61st game of the season, one shy of the 62 he played in his first season with the Lakers in 2019-20, the most of his Lakers’ tenure.
