Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard earning a starting nod for the East stirred debate. But the vet showcased his pedigree Sunday in becoming the first player in NBA history to win the 3-Point Contest and All-Star Game MVP in the same year.
Lillard joins Curry, Kyrie Irving, Rice and Larry as the only players to capture both awards throughout their careers. The NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award is a first for the eight-time All-Star. Lillard played his first seven All-Star games as a member of the Western Conference, before heading East back in October as part of a three-team trade.
