Indianapolis’ hometown team didn’t stop at Mathurin’s MVP. Nope, the Kia Skills Challenge at 2024 State Farm All-Star Saturday Night marked the third straight year in which the home team walked off the floor victorious.
This time, Team Pacers (comprised of Haliburton, Mathurin and Turner) did it at Lucas Oil Stadium (the home of the Indianapolis Colts), seizing the first two rounds worth 100 challenge points apiece. Team-All Stars (Scottie Barnes, Tyrese Maxey and Trae Young) took the 200-point shooting round. For the third consecutive year, the Skills Challenge came down to a tie-breaker round, comprised of half-court shots.
