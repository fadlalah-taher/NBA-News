3-pointers: The Bucks' Malik Beasley (8.8%) serves a specialized role as the floor spacer for Doc Rivers' offense. For some context to his volume, he's second only to this Stephen Curry guy in added value via 3-pointers on the Player Rater the past month. Meanwhile, Quickley and George both are in the top 12 in this index during this sample. Steals: The twins Ausar Thompson (46.3%) and Amen Thompson (21.4%) are larcenous defenders worthy of our attention, as they both rank in the top seven in added steal value the past month. The Pelicans' Herbert Jones (31.7%) also merits mention.
