On Friday, February 16, 2024, we will host the 24th annual NBA All-Star Technology Summit in Indianapolis. The Promise of Preventive Health: How Tech-Driven Personalized Care Can Improve Longevity. We all know that injuries are part of sports, but what if they didn’t have to be? From AI to genomic (DNA-based) medicine, a new wave of technology promises to identify health risk factors, prevent injuries and illnesses before they happen, and better personalize and optimize recovery, treatment and overall care. This panel will explore how these innovations can promote athletes’ health and wellbeing, and also discuss the potential risks of overreliance on technology.
