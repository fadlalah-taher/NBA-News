His case, the Thunder star picked up his career-high 46th game with 30 points or more this season in Wednesday’s win at Portland to cap a four-game road trip. He’s now only one game short of the OKC franchise record for 30-point games, reached twice by Kevin Durant (2009-10 and ’13-14). The Thunder host Miami on Friday (8 ET, NBA League Pass) with the Heat poised to play the second night of a back-to-back set.
