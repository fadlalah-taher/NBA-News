Shooting guards are taller than point guards. Height at the position varies; many bigger shooting guards also play small forward. Shooting guards should be good ball handlers and be able to pass reasonably well, though passing is not their main priority. Since good shooting guards may attract double-teams, they are frequently the team's back-up ball handlers to the point guard and typically get a fair number of assists. The Basketball Handbook by Lee Rose describes a SG as a player whose primary role is to score points. And most shooting guards are good long-range shooters, typically averaging 35â€“40 percent from three-point range.
