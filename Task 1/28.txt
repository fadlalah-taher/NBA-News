When it comes to statistics, small forwards must be all over the map and at least have stats in every category. And having adequate footwork and a solid defensive stance contributes to why small forwards are successful. There are many excellent small forwards that are well known for their contributions and versatility. Small forwards inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Julius Erving, Larry Bird, James Worthy, Elgin Baylor, Paul Pierce, John Havlicek, Scottie Pippen, Alex English, Bernard King. And now some of the small forward in NBA includes Vince Williams Jr, Royce O'Neale and Trey Murphy.
