What Miami did from there last spring, playing its way to the NBA Finals, helped legitimize the Play-In. There’s more sheen to it now, too, thanks to the powerhouse teams and big-name stars, the Sacramento Kings, the Dallas Mavericks, the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Lakers, clumped around that possibility in the West. Few NBA players start their season eyeing the Play-In as a goal. With each thrill balanced by a setback (and vice versa), through all the time spent on the road and in trainers’ rooms, even a taste of the postseason in a Game 83 and maybe 84 can start to look good to many.
