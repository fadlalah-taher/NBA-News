Lillard successfully defended his title in the Starry 3-Point Contest, while Mac McClung took his second-straight AT&T Slam Dunk contest crown in a showdown with Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown. Colleague Shaun Powell cleverly nicknamed McClung’s winning dunk the “Mac-A-Shaq” and boy, it was a doozy from the 6-foot-2 highflyer, who jumped over the 7-foot-1 Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal for a reverse jam. McClung became the first player since Zach LaVine 2015 to repeat as dunk contest champion. Lillard, meanwhile, dramatically took his second-straight title, too, nailing his final shot of what had been a hotly contested competition.
