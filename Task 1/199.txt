The 2024 National Basketball Association draft, the 78th edition of the National Basketball Association's annual draft, will be held over two nights instead of one like previous drafts. This will be the first time the NBA draft was held on multiple nights since the NBA decided to shorten the NBA draft down to two rounds instead of as little as three or seven rounds back in the late 1980s. The first round will be on June 26, 2024, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and the second round on June 27 at ESPNâ€™s Seaport District Studios in Manhattan.
