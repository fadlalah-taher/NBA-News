We’ve seen that technology is synonymous with the National Basketball Association. So, is anyone surprised someone devised the idea to build a 27-million-pixel floor to compete on for 2024 State Farm All-Star Saturday Night? The new floor debuted at the 2024 Ruffles National Basketball Association All Star Celebrity Game, and it’s still surreal that the league held all these entertaining events on what was essentially a massive Jumbotron. It’s more complicated than that, of course. The digitized floor can display graphics, video, interactive games, and even animations that track players’ movements with graphics such as a trail of stars.
