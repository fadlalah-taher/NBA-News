The NBA, PS&E and State Farm will unveil renovations to the Christamore House â€“ a local youth and adult services center. The renovations create a Live, Learn or Play Center and includes a refurbished gymnasium, a new STEAM lab named in honor of the Simon Family Foundation, a revitalized wellness room and internet and connectivity upgrades. Since 2020, the Host Committee invested more than $1 million statewide to provide a space for families and youth to come together through the power of basketball. Additionally, 45 students from across Indiana were selected Rising Stars and awarded scholarships to pursue college.
