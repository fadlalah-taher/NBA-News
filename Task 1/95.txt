This Nuggets team is awesome, mostly because Jokic remains awesome. The Nuggets are still very clearly the team to beat in the West. The difference this year is that the West is much better and deeper. The Clippers are awesome. The Thunder are young but absolutely loaded. The Warriors look like they've figured things out, and the emergence of Jonathan has changed everything for them. And the Suns are as dangerous as anyone if healthy. There were no teams like this in the West last season, especially after Ja Morant went down. The Nuggets should make the Finals. But it won't be a cakewalk.
