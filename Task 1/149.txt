Just last month they were five games under .500 and drowning from issues. Golden State is now frisky and, dare we say, starting to flex a bit. So yeah, perhaps the worst is over. Which doesn’t mean the Warriors are ready to do an abrupt about-face. Lots depends on Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins, two veterans who saw their production dip to start the season. The good news is the young players, especially Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski, are proving worthy of crunch time minutes. Escaping the Play-In Tournament is the Warriors’ goal, but they’ll need to leapfrog some decent teams.
