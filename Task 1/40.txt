Marvin Bagley III is an American professional basketball player for the Washington Wizards of the NBA. He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils and was a 2018 Consensus All-American. Bagley, Wizards (19.4%): The Wizards might have netted a gem in the deadline deal that brought Bagley over; while he's still not yet a refined two-way option, his ability to clean the glass and score from the post represents development in his career arc. The good news is also that the team created minutes and touches for him at the deadline in dealing off Daniel Gafford. Bagley will not play Wednesday versus Orlando.
