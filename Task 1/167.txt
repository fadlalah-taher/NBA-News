Anthony Edwards scored 16 of his season-high tying 44 points in the fourth quarter, but saved his biggest play for the final defensive possession of the game. With a chance to put the Wolves up three with seven seconds left, Edwards missed a free throw. The Pacers grabbed the rebound, pushed the ball upcourt and found Aaron Nesmith on the wing with an open lane to the basket. Edwards timed his chasedown perfectly, rising WAY up to swat away the shot off the glass with 2.3 seconds left for one of the greatest game-saving blocks ever. Mike Conley secured the rebound for the 113-111 win.
