The Oakland A's are in the process of getting approved for relocation to Las Vegas, where they would have a 33,000 seat ballpark that will likely be domed and sit on nine acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip. The owner's vote is expected to occur next month and the A's will need 75% yes votes in order to clear what is seen as their final hurdle. A's needing a near sellout (27,000) each and every game for 30 straight seasons in order to pay back the bonds being issued to them to construct the park in the first place.
