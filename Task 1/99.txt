Weitzman answering on Just four games currently separate the seed New Orleans Pelicans and the No. 10 seed Lakers. Which two teams among the Pelicans, Suns, Kings, Mavericks, Warriors and Lakers do you predict will narrowly miss out on the playoffs? We've seen that the Lakers can't slow the Kings, so what happens if they meet them in the play-in? But if I have to choose two, I'll go with the Pelicans and Lakers as the two who seem to be the most vulnerable in a play-in format. The Pelicans have trouble scoring, especially down the stretch, and I don't trust the Lakers' ability to stop opposing guards.
