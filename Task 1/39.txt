Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal from high-percentage close attempts on defense, while scoring and rebounding with high efficiency on offense. In the 1950s and 1960s, George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979â€“80 season, however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of a traditional center diminish. Now NBA center includes Marvin Bagley, Wendell Carter Jr., Mason Plumlee, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic, Andre Drummond, Rudy Gobert, Alex Len, Brook Lopez and Al Horford.
