Trailing by five with 57 seconds left and reigning Clutch Player of the Year Deâ€™Aaron Fox having fouled out, the Kings closed the game on a 7-0 run to escape with a 131-129 win over the Spurs. Final 51 seconds: A Harrison Barnes runner and Malik Monk 3 tied it, before Domantas Sabonis came up with the steal and breakaway dunk for the final points of the night.
Fox (33 pts) and Sabonis (31 pts) combined for 64 points to help the Kings keep pace with the Suns in the standings. Sacramento stays at No. 7, just a half game back of No. 6 Phoenix.
